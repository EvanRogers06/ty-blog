                            <p>Once I entered the building of Red Hat, I reacheda receptionarea and was greeted by a woman
                                named Becky, I was sent to desk where we were given a laptop, a keycard and a bag of various gifts such as a water
                                bottle and a speaker. </p>
                            
                            <p>We were then escorted out into a conference room, where we were intoduced to some members of staff,
                                and told eachother what schools we were from, after this we were given icebreaker games to do,
                                such as one where each of us had a famous persons name stuck to our back and we had to ask people questions
                                on who we had, we then were given a roleplay to do about how Red Hat makes its money
                            </p>
                            <h3 class="has-text-centered">We then were told about what we would be doing for the week</h3>
                            <p> We were then given a tour of the building which was given to us from becky, then we were allowed
                                 to have our lunch. Upon us finishing lunch,we had returned to the conference room and we were given

                                 , we were then tasked with creating a blog on how our week at Red Hat went,with us needing to update it daily in accordance with any events or workshops
                                   that take place over our time.
